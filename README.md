# Gold Designer Nails 

Gold Designer Nails is a modern e-commerce webpage I created that sells **press-on nails** and other nail products. The application is built using **JavaScript, HTML5, CSS3, Node.js, Express.js, jQuery, and JSON**. It features a **search bar** that dynamically filters products, making it easy for customers to find what they need.
